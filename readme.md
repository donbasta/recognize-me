# Face Recognition for Attendance

## Starting the program:

* Create and activate new virtual environment
`python3 -m venv env`
`env\Scripts\activate.bat` (windows) or `source env/bin/activate` (unix)

* Install requirements inside the virtual environment
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

* Run the face recognition program 
### Via webcam:
`python main.py`

## Adding new faces to recognize
New faces could be added from several new pictures. For convenience, please just upload a picture containing a single person to added, 
because if there are multiple faces you need to label them manually one by one. New faces could also be generated by using a video,
and running `python preprocessor/video_to_image_generator.py`.

The details about the data folder could be read in `./data/readme.md`

## Retraining the added images
New processed images will be put in the folder `data/processed_face`. Run `python preprocessor/embedder.py` to create feature embeddings of 
a person.
